                  Volunteering reduces stress and increases positive, relaxed
                  feelings by releasing dopamine. By spending time in service to
                  others, volunteers report feeling a sense of meaning and
                  appreciation, both given and received, which can have a
                  stress-reducing effect.

                <p className="benefits-p">
                  The work that volunteers provide is essential to everyday
                  activities, which gives volunteers a sense of purpose,
                  especially when volunteering in the areas they find
                  meaningful. Older volunteers experience greater increases in
                  life satisfaction and self-esteem.

                  Volunteering increases social interaction and helps build a
                  support system based on common interests. One of the best ways
                  to make new friends and strengthen existing relationships is
                  to participate in a shared activity.
